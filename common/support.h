/**
 * \ingroup Utilities
 *
 * Tests that the CPU and Operating System support the vector unit which was compiled for. This
 * function should be called before any other Vc functionality is used to check whether the program
 * will work. If this function returns \c false then the program should exit with
 * a non-zero exit status.
 *
 * If the program continues and makes use of any vector features not supported by
 * hard- or software then the program will crash.
 *
 * Example:
 * \code
 * int main()
 * {
 *   if (!Vc::currentImplementationSupported()) {
 *     std::cerr << "CPU or OS requirements not met for the compiled in vector unit!\n";
 *     exit -1;
 *   }
 *   ...
 * }
